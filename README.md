# PR

A browser extension to add some things to Github.

* show contributors to the files changed in a PR
* show commit messages for the respective changes in a PR
* show the full Travis CI matrix, instead of just the PR's build status
* change the color of the page's favicon depending on the PR build status
* ignore the changes of selected commits in the diff view

## Setup

Currently (this will change):

* go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
* create a new token, copy it
* open the console, do `localStorage.setItem('GH_TOKEN', 'copy-your-token-here');`
* in Chrome/Chromium, go to chrome://extensions/
* check "Developer mode"
* click "Load unpacked extension..."
* select the `ext/` directory here
